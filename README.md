# Personal Full-Stack Web Application

Welcome to my personal full-stack web application project. This project is built using NestJS and NextJS and is designed to cater to my specific needs.

## Project Overview

The general idea of this personal project is to create a versatile and customizable web application that I can use on both my PC and phone. The application will consist of various modules, with the potential to expand and customize based on my evolving needs. Some of the key modules include:

- **Fitness Tracker:** Track exercises, sets, reps, weights, timers, and statistics - similar to FitNotes.
- **Task Tracker:** Similar to a todoist but made for my personal needs.
- **Pomodoro Timer:** A productivity tool for time management because why not.
- **Note Taking:** Featuring a WYSIWYG editor for easy note creation.
- **Finance Tracker:** Monitor income and expenditures across various accounts.
- **Other Features:** I am open to suggestions for additional modules that could enhance the application.

## Project Philosophy

- **Single User:** This application is exclusively for my personal use. Users are expected to host their own instances to utilize it. I may choose to share it with friends, enabling them to host their own instances as well. However, I do not intend to support multiple users per instance unless it becomes necessary.
